# Shimarin

## Introduction

Shimarin is a (WIP) Self-Hosted Discord Music Bot written in Typescript.  
Most of the inspiration came from [jagrosh's music bot](https://github.com/jagrosh/MusicBot).  

This bot was made with the intent of learning Typescript. So the code might be bad in places or not follow conventions.  

I'll be working on improving this somewhat.

## Features

- Cleans up user commands
- Only uses 1 message which is updated in favor of creating a new one every time a command is issued (which would clutter the chat log).
- Support for Youtube song urls
- Searching for youtube songs by keyword
- Reaction based bot interaction system. The amount of commands you need to use is minimal
- Shows song progression
